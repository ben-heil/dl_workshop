## Tips for learning biology:
* Don't try to learning *everything* - try to start with one specific question and use that as a foundation to expand from (i.e. "what is the role of accessory genes in *P. aeruginosa* infection?" >> "What is the definition of these accessory genes?" >> "how do people relate accessory genes to infection?"). Think about starting with one question and as you try to answer this one question you'll find other ones that will expand your knowledge.
